# MoleTrans
MoleTrans is a webtool for post analysis and data mining on the formula assigned datasets from FT-ICR MS. Alternatively, it can partialy support the combined analysis on the compound annotated results based on other mass spectrometry. You can access MoleTrans at www.moletrans.cn. To secure the stable operation, we require your registration for usage. You can email to liujibaoneu@163.com for registration. Optionally, we provide the public account for your trying (user:demo  PW: demo). 

Here, we provide the source code for the main calculation functions/algorithms. If you used our codes and webtool, we hope you can cite our relevant papers.
